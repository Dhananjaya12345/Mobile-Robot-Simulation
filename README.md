# Mobile-Robot-Simulation

Project Overview:
The goal is to model the movement of a mobile robot in a 2D plane. We'll visualize its path, simulate its motion over time, and draw the robot in real-time. Sounds fun, right? Let‚Äôs get started!

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components:

Initialization: Set up the sampling time, initial states (position and orientation), and other simulation parameters.

Main Loop: Update the robot‚Äôs position and orientation at each time step based on given velocities.

Drawing Function: Visualize the robot's body, tires, and path at each time step using MATLAB‚Äôs plotting functions.

üé® Visual Highlights:

Smooth Motion: The robot follows a smooth, continuous path, making it visually appealing.

Real-Time Update: The simulation updates and visualizes the robot‚Äôs position in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

Robot Body & Tires: The detailed drawing function visualizes the robot's body and tires, enhancing understanding of its motion.

üåü Why This Project is Awesome:

Interactive Learning: This project is a great way to understand how differential equations can model real-world systems.

Visual Appeal: Seeing the robot move and trace its path makes the simulation engaging and fun.

Hands-On Experience: Perfect for students, hobbyists, or anyone interested in robotics and simulation.
